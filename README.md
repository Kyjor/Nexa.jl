# My game library: Nexa
I am currently creating a simple game library for the Julia programing language. It is called Nexa and at the moment I have simple key presses, image loading, and a simple game loop. It is not much right now but I only started working on it 2 days ago. 

## My goal:
My goal for this project is to make a simple library to easily make games in Julia. Something like raylib, its not too bloated, very easy to use, very powerful, and can make just about anything.

## Why am I making this? 
Well one the julia game dev ecosystem is super scarce and there are only a couple libraries that are actually good. 
### [GameZero](https://github.com/aviks/GameZero.jl):
It's simple but you can only use one file and doesn't really seem to be good for large scale projects. 
### [JulGame](https://github.com/Kyjor/JulGame.jl):
Its pretty good so far. The main thing that loses me is the fact that it has a required editor. I am not a big fan of that because I want something more like a "game framework" instead of a "game engine" meaning I don't really want an editor like unity or something. 
### [Bplus](https://github.com/heyx3/Bplus.jl):
It is really well made but it is very low level and I want something that's easier for someone to get into.
